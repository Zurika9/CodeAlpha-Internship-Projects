# 🤖 CodeAlpha AI ChatBot

> A Java-based Artificial Intelligence ChatBot developed as **Task 3** for the **CodeAlpha Java Programming Internship
**.

## 📌 Project Overview

CodeAlpha AI ChatBot is a desktop application built using **Java Swing** that allows users to interact with a chatbot
through a graphical user interface.

The chatbot uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP) preprocessing**, a **rule-based response engine**, a **FAQ
knowledge base**, and a **dynamic learning mechanism** to provide intelligent responses. When the chatbot encounters an
unknown question, it can learn a new answer from the user and permanently store it for future conversations.

# ✨ Features

- ✅ Java Swing graphical user interface
- ✅ Real-time chatbot interaction
- ✅ Rule-based AI response engine
- ✅ Natural Language Processing (NLP) preprocessing
- ✅ FAQ knowledge base
- ✅ Dynamic learning for unknown questions
- ✅ Persistent knowledge storage
- ✅ Chat history saved to a text file
- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) architecture
- ✅ Modular and maintainable code structure

---

# 🧠 NLP Techniques Used

The chatbot performs basic Natural Language Processing before searching the knowledge base.

Current preprocessing includes:

- Converting text to lowercase
- Removing punctuation
- Removing extra spaces
- Normalizing user input

Example:

| User Input     | Processed Input |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Hello!!!       | hello           |
| HOW ARE YOU?   | how are you     |
| What is Java?? | what is java    |
